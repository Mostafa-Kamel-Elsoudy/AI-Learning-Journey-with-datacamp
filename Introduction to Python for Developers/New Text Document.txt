## Python as a calculator

# Add 19 and 17
print(19 + 17)

# Subtract 12 from 99
print(99 - 12)

# Multiply 27 by 23
print(27 * 23)

# Divide 99 by 12
print(99/12)

## Advanced calculations

# Calculate and print nine squared
print(9**2)

# Find the remainder from 337 divided by 27
print(337%27)


## Checking data types

# Print the data type of current_quarter
print(type(current_quarter))
# Print the data type of 9.75
print(type(9.75))
# Print the data type of revenue_on_target
print(type(revenue_on_target))

## Working with variables
# Create a string variable called name
name = "John Smith"

# Create an integer variable called age
age = 47

# Create a string variable called address
address = "The Shard, London, SE1 9SG"

# Print their information
print(name, age,  address)
